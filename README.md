## Overview

The provided web app sets up a server that communicates with OpenAI's ChatGPT API, accepts user queries through a web interface, sends these queries to the API, and displays the AI's response.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js

### Obtaining an OpenAI API Key

1. Visit [OpenAI's API platform](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and sign up or log in.
2. Navigate to the API section and create a new API key for your application.
3. Copy the API key, which you'll use in the app to authenticate API requests.

### Project Structure

The application's file structure:

```
/my-app
|-- /public
|   |-- /css
|   |   |-- style.css
|   |-- /js
|   |   |-- script.js
|   |-- index.html
|-- server.js
|-- package.json
|-- .env
|-- .gitignore
```

- `/public`: Static files served by the server.
- `server.js`: Main server file handling API requests.
- `.env`: Contains environment variables like the OpenAI API key.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files to be ignored by version control.

### Installation

To set up the app, clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
npm install
```

## Using the App

### Server Setup

In the root of your project, create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Client Interaction

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. Use the web interface to submit queries to the ChatGPT API and see responses.

## Customization

You can customize the styles by modifying `public/css/style.css` and extend the app functionality by changing `server.js` and `public/js/script.js`.
